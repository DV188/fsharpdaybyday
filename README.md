# F# Day by Day
This repository is dedicated to learning the language F# in tiny increments. The idea is you come back to the repo every day for a small dose of Functional Programming (FP).

What F# is, is best said by its current "owner", the F# Foundation at [fsharp.org](http://fsharp.org):

> F# is a mature, open source, cross-platform, functional-first programming language. It empowers users and organizations to tackle complex computing problems with simple, maintainable and robust code.

Whereas "functional-first" means, F# is not purely functional, but also imperative and object-oriented. It's a hybrid or multi-paradigm language. It favors pragmatism over fundamentalism - and strives to make the transition for mono-paradigm language developers into the FP-world easier.

If this does not provide enough motivation for you to learn F#, get some inspiration from the "[Why use F#?](http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/series/why-use-fsharp.html)" series of articles by Scott Wlaschin.

F# currently is available for the .NET/Mono platform, which means it can not only be used on Windows, but also on Linux and Mac OS. It was originally developed by Microsoft's [Don Syme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Syme), but since then has been made open source.

There are many resources on F# available for the curious. [fsharp.org](http://fsharp.org) has compiled many fine books and articles and provides guidance for setting up F# on your computer.

Even F# coding environments exist online. Check out

If you don't yet want to clutter your hard disk/desktop with another IDE you can follow along the daily F# snippets with one of the above lightweight REPL environments.

### More motivation needed?
If you're technically declined you might be satisfied with the above pitch for why it's worthwhile to get to know F#. But about your boss? Does she care?

Fortunately there is a business side to all those buzzwords. Choosing F# over for example C# or VB is a matter of economics.

Yes, it's economically prudent to switch to F#, the more so if you're already programming for the .NET platform. The reason is simple: **evolvability and productivity**.

Writing code in F# produces **less lines of code** (LOC). F# is a very terse language compared to C#, Java or C++. And less lines of code mean less to read, easier understanding, and usually less effort to change. Some even report an order of magnitude of LOC reduction after switching from an OO language to F#.

In addition F# code is (or at least can be) **much more expressive** with regard to your data. It's easy to map your domain language into code. This further enhances understanding.

And finally it is **much easier to adhere to clean code principles and patterns** with F#. Some of them are just workarounds for problems with mainstream object-orientation, so they don't apply. Some of them, on the other hand, can be translated more straightforwardly from design into code.

So even if you're not interested in lofty discussions about the merits of Functional Programming, even if you don't care about the benefits of immutability for concurrent programming... even then you should give F# a try. Because it's a language to please your customers with. They might not understand nor see F# code. But they sure will love if you're quicker to adapt your code base to new requirements.

And now, without further ado, enter into the realm of F# on [day #1](week01/day01).

This introductory training for F# is brought to you by the [Clean Code Developer School](http://ccd-school.de), Germany. We also founded the German [Clean Code Developer](http://clean-code-developer.de) community with [currently 4000+ members](http://xing.com/net/ccd) in 2009 and have been teaching principles and practices for clean coding and fluent software production since then to many hundred developers.
